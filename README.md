# NumPy
A brief introduction to NumPy, a library for the Python programming language

I'm a math geek, so naturally the NumPy library would be one of my favorites. 
NumPy allows Python users to utilize a large collection of high-level math functions and operations.
It's especially useful for manipulating large datasets and performing calculations on them.

Setting up NumPy is fairly simple. 

With pip, you can install NumPy by typing the following in your Terminal: 'pip install numpy'
(Installation with pip may vary depending on your version of Python, e.g. 'pip3 install numpy' for Python 3.)
